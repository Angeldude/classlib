## ClASSLIB for Abstract Algebra: a computational approach

### What is this?
This is a math library for the Abstract Algebra book by Charles C. Sims. It took me a while to hunt this down before I decided to search on Github and found just one repository with a single file: a Dyalog APL workspace.

It was from here that I took it upon myself to export all the components so that I can put it in a more 'universal' APL format.

### Work in Progress
This is still incomplete, if you want to start using the full CLASSLIB, use the Dyalog file (.dws), all the other files are missing some variable definitions but all the functions are there!

### What's in it?
I provide `.atf` files for each function and variable, 1 full `.atf` file with everything in it, an APLX workspace with everything in it, and an exported Dyalog extended workspace from the original Dyalog file.
